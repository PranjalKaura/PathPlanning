# Path Planning using Rapidly-Exploring Random Trees (RRT)

This project implements Rapidly-Exploring Random Trees (RRT) for obstacle-avoiding path planning. RRT is designed to efficiently explore high-dimensional spaces by randomly sampling feasible paths.

## Features

**Obstacle Avoidance**: Safely navigates through complex environments. \
**Multi-Language Implementation**: Available in Python and C++. \
**Visualization**: Graphical representation of paths and obstacles. \
**Algorithms**: ArtificialPotential & Bi-Directional

## Tech Stack

**Python and C++** for algorithm implementation. \
**Matplotlib** for path visualization.


## How to Run
Run the following command to execute the program.
```
g++ -o main main.cpp -I/usr/include/python3.8 -lpython3.8
```
